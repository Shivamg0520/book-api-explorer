# 📚 Random Book Finder (API Practice)

This is a simple Python project created while practicing **REST APIs**.  
It fetches random book details from the **[FreeAPI Books API](https://freeapi.app/)** and displays information like title, author, publisher, published date, and description.

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches **random book details** using an API.
- Displays useful metadata (ID, Title, Author, Publisher, Published Date, Description).
- Demonstrates **API integration** with Python's `requests` library.
- Beginner-friendly project to learn how to **call APIs & parse JSON data**.
